     a. Stretching out a sound: "<<Ssssssometimes>> I feel nervous.", "<<Mmmmmaybe>> we should leave."
    3. Blocks (Silent or Audible Pauses):
     a. Sudden stops before or during a word: "I want to... (pause)... go.", "He... (tense pause)... left."
    4. Interjections or Fillers (can be normal or excessive): "Um... I was going to the store." "Like... like... I mean..."
